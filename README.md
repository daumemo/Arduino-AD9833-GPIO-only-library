# Arduino AD9833 GPIO-only library
A small CPP library for the AD9833. It is Arduino based library used on ESP-32, but it also should work on other Arduino platforms. This library is one big class with several methods in it. Instead of SPI hardware pins the library uses three regular IO pins – for SCK, FSYNC(CS) and DATA(MOSI).
